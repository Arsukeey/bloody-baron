            You are stuck in a building with nine people, and there's a murderer between them.\n
            For each round, which lasts for 30 in-game minutes, you'll be able to move 
            between rooms and talk to people, and try and gain their trust.\n
            If you gain someone's trust, you'll acquire a new ability associated with that person, 
            some of them are passive, some active, but all of them are helpful in order to
            solve the mistery.\n
            You can also check people's profiles before engaging in conversation with them.\n
            During the day, if someone (including you) spends one hour alone with the killer in the same room, 
            this person dies. If you die, it's game over. If someone else dies, though, 
            after the corpse is discovered by you, a trial 
            will happen, and you'll vote in order to execute someone. People who trust in you are likely to vote for 
            the same as you, and people will vote for those who they have the least affinity with.\n
            During night, you need to be extra careful, because if someone meets the killer, they're 
            instantly dead.\n
            You have the option to stay locked in your room during night and sleep, and you'll be safe, 
            but someone always dies during the night, so, be prepared to look for a corpse after dawn.\n\n
            Simply put, talk to people to build trust, use the abilities wisely and your logical thinking 
            to find out who's the killer, and don't get killed yourself.\n
            There's two ways to lose this game: either be the only one remaining besides the killer, or get killed. 
            You win when you get the real killer executed and sleep a peaceful night.\n
