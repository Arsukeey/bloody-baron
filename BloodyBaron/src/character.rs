        and has been living according to noble standards ever since. 
        While gazing at Freya's blue eyes, you wonder what goes on in her mind, especially in the situation she's in right now, 
        as a murder suspect. 
        You'd think that someone who's known to be so brilliant wouldn't commit a terrible murder without reason. Still...\n
        Personality: Freya is cold and is usually caught wandering in thoughts, even during conversations. 
        If you want to befriend her, you should be prepared to go through long moments of silence.\n

        His tanned skin and old, wise aura are persistent even when being a suspect of political murder, as is the case 
        right now. This could be a bless... or a curse. Because you never know what lies behind such an benevolent looking

        seems to be constantly having fun. You couldn't possibly imagine a creature like this killing in cold blood. Yet...\n
        Personality: expect cheerfullness and some blissful innocence from Luna. It's rather easy to gain her trust, but hurting
